SVM-rank Experiments on LETOR 3.0	
=================================

Author: Thorsten Joachims

The experiments were conducted with SVM-rank V1.00 available at 

    http://svmlight.joachims.org/svm_rank.html

SVM-rank solves the same optimization problem as SVM-light with the '-z p' option, but is much faster (on average around 
a second on my travel laptop with a 1.2Ghz Pentium). 

For all datasets the learner was called with

    svm_rank_learn -c <C> -e 0.001 -l 1 train.txt model

where <C> takes the values (0.00001,0.00002,0.00005,0.0001,0.0002,0.0005,0.001,0.002,0.005,0.01,0.02,0.05,0.1,0.2,0.5). 
For each fold, the <C> value with the best MAP performance on the validation set was selected and its test set performance 
is reported. The <C> value that achieved best validation set performance is shown in the filename of the results files and 
the log files of each run. In particular, they are:
